# appsProj
JavaFX
This project was bootstrapped with 5 teammates tears, passions, laughs, and excitements!!


Inspiration
We started with wanting to build a social application for people to build a character sheet easily without having to pay for the $20 PDF
What it does
Put together a character using Mage the ascension 20th anniversary edition

Using that data, we can connect people from around the world with their character sheets

How we built it
We built our app using JavaFX, one main controller, 6 controllers, and of course, JavaFX

APIs we used: N/A

Challenges we ran into
The main challenge hit us close to our deadline, we need to convert all progress bars in a previous patch over to Text due to the constraints of JavaFX.
We continue to get loading errors when trying to initialize more than 12 of these elements.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of successfully completing an appliction that you can't find on the internet (really we tried).

What we learned
We learned that Git can make or break a project, and it is highly important to be on the same page with this.

What's next for us?
We want to hear feedback from our users!!
